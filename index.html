          <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
          <p>Oxford Dictionaries chose the term “post-truth” as its 2016 Word of
            the Year, defining it as the condition that exists when
            “objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion
            than appeals to emotion and personal belief.”</p>
          <p>Noted author, George Orwell, in his novel <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>,
            observed: “In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth becomes
            a revolutionary act.”  At this juncture, early in 2017,  it seems
            that there is no more important time to be vigilant as consumers of
            media than in the era of "alternative facts" and "fake news",
            perpetrated by those on both the sociopolitical right and left who
            seek to manipulate public opinion without regard for truth.</p>
          <p>We envision our group as a grass-roots effort to raise awareness
            of the immense importance of a free and principled press, both
            resisting the allure of “fake news” and celebrating integrity in
            all forms of media. With that broad statement of purpose in mind,
            our hope is that the mission of the group evolves organically in
            response to the ideas and dispositions of its constituents as well
            as to the developments that occur in the current political
            landscape. Our activism would emerge from serious study and
            thoughtful, informed discussion.</p>
